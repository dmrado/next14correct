This project is a website for a non-commercial society organization.

All pages, apart from posts, are static. The posts page uses CRUD operations to add, update, read, and remove posts of only one user with id=1. React Quill is used to add and update posts. Nodemailer is used to send mail from a form on the ContactsPage.js. MySQL is used as the database. ORM Sequelize is also used. The .env file contains all environment variables. The config/mail.json contains all the necessary settings for Nodemailer. The config/config.json contains all the necessary settings for Sequelize connection.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
